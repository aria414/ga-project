             A visual novel is a game that is heavily story based. Players read through the stories and are often asked to select a choice. Selecting certain choices will make the story branch of to another scenario, or take them to a different "route". Different routes may have completely different ending. Sometimes players have to get a certian number of choices correct to unlock a happy ending. Othertimes they unlock the normal ending.
